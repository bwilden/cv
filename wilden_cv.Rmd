# Current Projects

**Improved Bayesian Ethnorace Prediction**. I develop a method for imputing individual level race/ethnicity using Bayes' Rule. When validated against self-reported race/ethnicity, my method vastly out-performs existing methods across a wide range of predictive metrics. I demonstrate that my method uncovers substantively-large racial disparities in real world applications that are not apparent when using predictions from older methods. Implementation is made easy by an open source software package in `R` https://github.com/bwilden/bper

**Interest Group Ideal Points**, with Nhat-Dang Do. We estimate latent political ideology scores for interest groups lobbying in the California state legislature using a bespoke hierarchical Bayesian item-response theory model. We incorporate the latest modeling techniques from the Bayesian statistics literature to improve accuracy and validity of our results relative to previous ideal point estimation methods. 

**A Constitutive Causal Theory of Race**. Most social science research purporting to examine the effect of one's race on an outcome implicitly uses a theoretically incoherent understanding of race. Under the widely-accepted constructivist understand of race, it is impossible to isolate the "effect" of race as required by classic counterfactual causal inference paradigms. In this project I critique existing quantitative methods using race and offer an alternative framework which incorporates race's constitutive elements. These constitutive elements are identified empirically using a structural learning algorithm to find the Markov Blanket surrounding the race variable in a particular data set.
