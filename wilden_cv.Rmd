Race and Ethnic Politics · Ethics in AI/Machine Learning · Bayesian Statistics · Causal Inference

# Current Projects

**Improved Bayesian Ethnorace Prediction** I develop a method for predicting individual level race/ethnicity using Bayes' Rule. Racial distributions from a nationwide surname list are combined with distributions from geolocations to yield predicted probabilities of individuals’ race and ethnicity. I expand upon existing methods by incorporating information from a nationwide list of first names as well as from residence characteristics. Along with some other adjustments, these improvements lead to substantial gains in predictive performance when validated against official state voter files.
