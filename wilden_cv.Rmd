**RMIG Ideal Points**, with Nhat-Dang Do. We estimate political ideal points of interest groups lobbying in the California state legislature using a hierarchical Bayesian item-response model. Our findings indicate that Racial Minority Interest Groups (RMIGs) lie on the far left of the ideological spectrum. In fact, they are more liberal than any other category of interest group (Public Interest, Labor, Education, Business, etc).

**Improved Bayesian Ethnorace Prediction** I develop a method for predicting individual level race/ethnicity using Bayes' Rule. Racial distributions from a nationwide surname list are combined with distributions from geolocations to yield predicted probabilities of individuals’ race and ethnicity. I expand upon existing methods by incorporating information from a nationwide list of first names as well as from residence characteristics. Along with some other adjustments, these improvements lead to substantial gains in predictive performance when validated against official state voter files.
